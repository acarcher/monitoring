We have released 4 one minute long videos of people driving cars.

Background
-----

We believe driver monitoring is key to the safety of the ramp to full self driving cars.

We wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@comma_ai/safety-and-driver-attention-2a33d3d23109">a lot more on our medium</a>


Challenge
-----

Your goal:
- Track their face
- Then, track their eyes
- Then, if you are bored, track their emotional state

Annotate nicely on the video and do a writeup with pictures.

Feel free to fork this and show off your solution on your GitHub.

We are hiring a full time "Driving Monitoring Engineer", and when you apply, we'll ask you complete this challenge.

When done, just show off on your GitHub or apply at givemeajob@comma.ai
