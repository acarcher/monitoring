They were recording with a <a href="https://shop.comma.ai/products/eon-dashcam-devkit">EON Dashcan DevKit</a>

Background
-----

We believe driver monitoring is one of the keys safely ramping up to full self driving cars.

We wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@comma_ai/safety-and-driver-attention-2a33d3d23109">a lot more on our medium</a>


Challenge
-----

Your goal:
- Track their face
- Then, track their eyes
- Then, if you are bored, track their emotional state

Annotate your tracking nicely on the video and do a writeup with pictures.

We are hiring a full time "Driving Monitoring Engineer", and when you apply, we'll ask you complete this challenge.

Feel free to fork this and show off your solution on your GitHub. Or, when done, apply for a job here at givemeajob@comma.ai
